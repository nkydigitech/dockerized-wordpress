# dockerized-wordpress

Hi, I’m Nkechi Ahanonye 👋  
This project helps me learn how to use Docker and Docker Compose to containerize applications.  
Here, I set up a local WordPress site with a MySQL database — all running in containers.

---

## 🧱 What's Inside

A `docker-compose.yml` file that:

- Spins up WordPress and MySQL containers
- Mounts volumes for persistent storage
- Connects both containers through a shared network

---

## ▶️ How to Run It

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.  
Then, in the project folder, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop and remove the containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## 🛠️ Why I Built This

- To practice containerizing real-world apps
- To understand how Docker Compose simplifies multi-container setups
- To build confidence for DevOps and cloud projects
